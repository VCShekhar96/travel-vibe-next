              <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold font-playfair mb-4 mt-12 text-foreground">The Sacred Ghats</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Varanasi is renowned for its magnificent ghatsâ€”stone steps leading down to the Ganges River. There are approximately 88 ghats stretching along the crescent-shaped riverbank, each with its own unique history and significance. The ghats are the lifeblood of Varanasi, where pilgrims perform sacred rituals, cremate their dead, and seek spiritual purification in the holy waters of the Ganges.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Dashashwamedh Ghat is the most famous and spiritually significant ghat, where the spectacular Ganga Aarti ceremony takes place every evening. This mesmerizing ritual involves priests performing synchronized movements with fire lamps while chanting ancient Vedic hymns, creating an unforgettable spiritual experience. Thousands of devotees and tourists gather daily to witness this magnificent ceremony that has been performed for centuries.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Manikarnika Ghat, known as the great cremation ground, is believed to be where Lord Shiva stood when he created the universe. Hindus believe that dying in Varanasi and being cremated at this ghat liberates the soul from the cycle of rebirth, granting moksha (salvation). The cremation fires here have been burning continuously for thousands of years, making it one of the most sacred sites in Hinduism.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Varanasi is home to over 2,000 temples, earning it the name "City of Temples." The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is the most sacred temple in the city and one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The temple's golden spire and dome are iconic landmarks of Varanasi's skyline. Pilgrims believe that a visit to this temple can wash away sins and grant spiritual liberation.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                The narrow lanes, or galis, of Varanasi form a labyrinth of ancient architecture, small shrines, and vibrant markets. These winding alleys have remained largely unchanged for centuries, preserving the authentic medieval character of the city. Walking through these lanes is like stepping back in time, where traditional silk weaving, brass work, and spiritual practices continue as they have for generations.

                Varanasi has been a center of learning and culture for thousands of years.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                A sunrise boat ride on the Ganges is an essential Varanasi experience. As the first rays of sunlight illuminate the ancient ghats and temples, pilgrims perform their morning rituals, and the city slowly awakens to another day of spiritual devotion. The sight of the sun rising over the sacred river, with the silhouettes of temples and the sounds of morning prayers, creates a profound and moving experience.
